Moss is one of the planet's oldest and most humble plants. It belongs to a group called bryophytes, which have been on Earth for over 450 million years, long before the first trees or flowers ever appeared. They are pioneers, often the very first life to colonize bare rock or disturbed soil.

Unlike more complex plants, moss has no true roots, flowers, or seeds. It absorbs water and nutrients directly through its tiny, simple leaves, which is why it thrives in damp, shady places. It reproduces using spores, which are released into the wind to find new places to grow.

What makes moss remarkable is its resilience. It can survive being completely dried out, entering a state of dormancy where it looks brown and lifeless. But with the slightest touch of moisture—a rain shower or even just morning dew—it can rehydrate and spring back to a vibrant green, resuming its quiet life.

It forms soft, green carpets over forest floors, clings to the bark of trees, and pushes up between cracks in the pavement. In its own slow, persistent way, moss softens the hard edges of the world, reminding us that life can flourish in the simplest of forms and in the most overlooked of places.
